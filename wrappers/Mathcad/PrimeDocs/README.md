# User Documentation for the Mathcad Prime RefProp Wrapper

This directory contains the User Guide for the Mathcad Prime wrapper for the NIST RefProp materials library.   The manual is built from actual Mathcad Prime documents and printed to PDF in stages.  If updates need to be made, the source documents are found in the `./DOCsrc` sub-folder.

Since these files are binary, changes and tracking are not recommended.  Changes should only be made if absolutely necessary to correct a serious error or to support major changes to the code.

To build a new PDF:

1. Edit the appropriate source documents in Mathcad Prime.
2. Print all source documents to PDF (not in this repository).
3. Assemble the PDF documents, in order, into one document.
4. Add Bookmarks to the Chapters and hyperlinks between chapters where appropriate.
